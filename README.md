There are three steps before a commit is shared with colleagues. Most version control systems have only one step, committing from the working copy to a shared server. 

1) In git you add files from the working copy to the staging area. 

2) After that you commit them to the local repo. 

3) The third step is pushing to a shared remote repository.
